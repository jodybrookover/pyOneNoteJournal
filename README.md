One Note Journaling that works with 64-bit Windows

There used to be a powertoy for MS Onenote that let you hit a keyboard shortcut to switch to/create a page for that day - http://www.tabletdev.com/tools/DailyJournal.aspx

Back when one note had only one notebook, it would create a section group called "Journal", and anohter section group under that named after the year (YYYY).  It would then create a section named after the Month (eg November).  Finally it would create a page with the date (eg 2013-11-23)

This worked fine for awhile, but then onenote got multiple notebooks, so it would only create all that stuff under the "default" Notebook - whatever that means. And you had to create the section group for the year or it would bomb.  But that wasn't so bad.

Now, sadly, with 64 bit windows 7 the powertoy doesn't work at all anymore.

I've created this little script for my own personal use that creates the date page.  I still have to manually create the notebook, Journal, Year, and Month parts.  



onepy.py came from here --> https://github.com/varunsrin/OnePy
Need to remove that probably. Not sure how
